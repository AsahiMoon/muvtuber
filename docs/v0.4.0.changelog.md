# v0.4.0 LipSync

This version brings the real lip-sync feature. 

We implemented the [issue #38](https://github.com/cdfmlr/muvtuber/issues/38), replacing the Live2dView dependence package [guansss/pixi-live2d-display](https://github.com/guansss/pixi-live2d-display) with [RaSan147/pixi-live2d-display](https://github.com/RaSan147/pixi-live2d-display) which supports the lip-sync based on audio analyzing. Thanks [@RaSan147](https://github.com/RaSan147) for his work.
MuvtuberDriver's sayer module is rewritten, joining with changes on Live2dDriver, to supports this new feature.

This feature also makes it easier to supports any live2d model. Latter versions (v0.4.x) will test & support the out-of-box live2d model replacement.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è  BREAKS

This version focus on the new feature and slightly neglect the stability as well as the compatibility. We have found the following important feature is broken:

- "ÊÇ≤Ê¨¢ÂΩ¢‰∫éËâ≤": the new lip-sync based on audio analyzing is not capable to works with the original live2d expression & motion control based on the text emotion analyzing .

Later versions (v0.4.x) will fix it.
